  description:
    - You are in your bedroom. It is the favourite part of your house because you
      can do what you like in there, and yet not get disturbed. There is a bed
      right in the middle of the squarish room, which takes up quite a bit of
      space, but you like it that way.
    - There is a [lamp] next to the bed, and a door leading to the [bathroom].
      There is another door leading to the [kitchen].
  leave:
    - if-not-state: room lit
      then-return-fail:
        The dark room is like a place out of time, a place to rest without
        consequence. Yet the darkness makes you fumble and lose your sense of
        direction.

    - if-not-state: using slippers
      then-return-fail:
        The cold from the floor moves in only to meet the warmth of your blood.
        You feel it wash over your skin, again and again, only to be met by the
        beat of your heart, again and again. You quickly pull your feet back in
        under the cover, the floor is way too cold.

- thing: lamp
  lookat:
    The sleek silver angle-poise lamp is simple and elegant - minimalist
    perhaps. You find it satisfyingly heavy too, a justification for the huge
    price tag. A device for giving light, either one consisting of an electric 
    bulb together with its holder and shade or cover, or one burning gas or a 
    liquid fuel and consisting of a wick or mantle and a glass shade.

      you are going.

- location: bathroom
  description:
    - You are in your bathroom. It is a place of washing, of nurturing our sanity
      with the sensation of warm water and aromatic soaps. For the body must feel
      loved and cared for, for then it feeds back these messages to the brain and
      begins to set up a positive cycle of wellness.
    - You can reach your [bedroom] from here.
    - Your [shower] is here.
  leave:
    if-not-state: using slippers
    then-fail: The floor is too cold.

      nourishment of others, to give of yourself, to put your soul into the food.
    - There is a door to your [bedroom]. The front door leads out ot the [garden].

- location: garden
  description:
    - The grass always seems to whisper in the spring, like a church full of
      people all saying ssssh together. The stalks sway with a salsa rhythm,
      nodding their heads in delight. At night, the wind dies down and a
      newly-minted moon appears, drenching shady glades with silver light. 
      Yipping fox cubs can be heard in the distance and the lonely hoot of an owl
      sounds like a phantom lost in the darkness.
    - The front door of your house leads directly to the [kitchen]. In front
      of the door sits yur [garden gnome].
  enter:
    if-not-state: teeth clean
    then-fail:
      Good teeth can impact so many areas of life, including how you feel about
      yourself. The health of the brain impacts body health and social mobility,
      and that impacts family health. Everything is connected, we are all
      connected. We are supposed to love and care for our neighbours, right?

- thing: garden gnome
  lookat:
    - set: seen gnome
    - You would sit in the garden, feeling joy from how the sunny rays warmed your
      skin, and listen to the tales of the gnome. For they talk, the gnomes, if
      you can listen with your heart while your ears enjoy the birdsong. The
      gnome's hat has gotten too old. It had been fraying for the best part of a
      century but now the stitching around the brim was coming away and even magic
      couldn't repair it. The once midnight blue fabric was almost an embarrassing
      navy and the pointed top drooped worse than a well used sock.
