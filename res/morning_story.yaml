    You are in your bedroom. It is the favourite part of your house because you
    can do what you like in there, and yet not get disturbed. There is a bed
    right in the middle of the squarish room, which takes up quite a bit of
    space, but you like it that way.

        The dark room is like a place out of time, a place to rest without

        The cold from the floor moves in only to meet the warmth of your blood.
        You feel it wash over your skin, again and again, only to be met by the

        under the cover, the floor is way too cold.

    You are in your bathroom. It is a place of washing, of nurturing our sanity
    with the sensation of warm water and aromatic soaps. For the body must feel
    loved and cared for, for then it feeds back these messages to the brain and
    begins to set up a positive cycle of wellness.

  description:
    The grass always seems to whisper in the spring, like a church full of
    people all saying ssssh together. The stalks sway with a salsa rhythm,
    nodding their heads in delight. At night, the wind dies down and a
    newly-minted moon appears, drenching shady glades with silver light. 
    Yipping fox cubs can be heard in the distance and the lonely hoot of an owl
    sounds like a phantom lost in the darkness.

    The sleek silver angle-poise lamp is simple and elegant - minimalist
    perhaps. You find it satisfyingly heavy too, a justification for the huge
    price tag. A device for giving light, either one consisting of an electric 
    bulb together with its holder and shade or cover, or one burning gas or a 
    liquid fuel and consisting of a wick or mantle and a glass shade.

  description:
    You would sit in the garden, feeling joy from how the sunny rays warmed your
    skin, and listen to the tales of the gnome. For they talk, the gnomes, if
    you can listen with your heart while your ears enjoy the birdsong. The
    gnome's hat has gotten too old. It had been fraying for the best part of a
    century but now the stitching around the brim was coming away and even magic
    couldn't repair it. The once midnight blue fabric was almost an embarrassing
    navy and the pointed top drooped worse than a well used sock.
